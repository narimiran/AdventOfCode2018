This year, I will do it once again in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/),
and ~~later on maybe in some other language too~~ in October 2021 I practiced Racket by solving some of the puzzles,
and some time before that (in 2021) I also solved the first half of the puzzles using Python.

For Nim solutions, my aim was to provide clean, readable, idiomatic code.
Python solutions extensively use `lambda`, and the aim was to provide short (but still readable) solutions.
I'm a beginner in Racket, so the solutions here are part of my learning of the language, and consequently might not be idiomatic.

[Day 1: Chronal Calibration](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1)           | [day01.nim](nim/day01.nim) | [day01.py](python/day01.py) | [day01.rkt](racket/day01.rkt) | Dogfooding by using [itertools](https://github.com/narimiran/itertools) to `cycle` through the input. Using `IntSet` for fast lookups.
[Day 2: Inventory Management System](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2)   | [day02.nim](nim/day02.nim) | [day02.py](python/day02.py) | [day02.rkt](racket/day02.rkt) | The original solution used `zip`, but that allocates a new sequence.
[Day 3: No Matter How You Slice It](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/3)    | [day03.nim](nim/day03.nim) | [day03.py](python/day03.py) | [day03.rkt](racket/day03.rkt) | No need for regex, `scanf` macro is great for these kinds of inputs. Using smaller integers instead of `int` gives noticeable speed boost. Using templates to keep the main part short and readable, without unnecessary repetitions.
[Day 4: Repose Record](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4)                 | [day04.nim](nim/day04.nim) | [day04.py](python/day04.py) | [day04.rkt](racket/day04.rkt) | [2018-12-04 06:00] Guard narimiran begins shift
[Day 5: Alchemical Reduction](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5)          | [day05.nim](nim/day05.nim) | [day05.py](python/day05.py) | [day05.rkt](racket/day05.rkt) | 4x speed improvement when using the already shortened polymer (first part) for the second part.
[Day 6: Chronal Coordinates](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/6)           | [day06.nim](nim/day06.nim) | [day06.py](python/day06.py) | [day06.rkt](racket/day06.rkt) | The slowest task so far.
[Day 7: The Sum of Its Parts](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/7)          | [day07.nim](nim/day07.nim) | [day07.py](python/day07.py) | [day07.rkt](racket/day07.rkt) | Using `heapqueue` is a no-brainer here.
[Day 8: Memory Maneuver](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/8)               | [day08.nim](nim/day08.nim) | [day08.py](python/day08.py) | [day08.rkt](racket/day08.rkt) | Using recursion is a no-brainer here.
[Day 9: Marble Mania](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/9)                  | [day09.nim](nim/day09.nim) | [day09.py](python/day09.py) | [day09.rkt](racket/day09.rkt) | Compile it with `--gc:regions` to get the most performance out of it.
[Day 10: The Stars Align](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/10)             | [day10.nim](nim/day10.nim) | [day10.py](python/day10.py) | [day10.rkt](racket/day10.rkt) | The first usage of Nim templates this year. Using [unpack](https://github.com/technicallyagd/unpack) for `<-` sequence unpacking.
[Day 11: Chronal Charge](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/11)              | [day11.nim](nim/day11.nim) | [day11.py](python/day11.py) | [day11.rkt](racket/day11.rkt) | Using [summed-area table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table) to have O(n^3) solution (naÃ¯ve solution is O(n^5)). Using threads gives 2x speed boost.
[Day 12: Subterranean Sustainability](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/12) | [day12.nim](nim/day12.nim) | [day12.py](python/day12.py) | [day12.rkt](racket/day12.rkt) | Nothing to write home about.
[Day 13: Mine Cart Madness](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/13)           | [day13.nim](nim/day13.nim) |                             |                               | Using [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane) is the obvious choice for the tasks like this, but `complex` in Nim is limited to floats, so I decided to use plain old tuples of integers.
[Day 14: Chocolate Charts](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/14)            | [day14.nim](nim/day14.nim) |                             |                               | Using `int8` to keep the memory usage down.
[Day 15: Beverage Bandits](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/15)            |                            |                             |                               | Ain't nobody got time for that.

[Day 20: A Regular Map](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/20)               | [day20.nim](nim/day20.nim) |                             |                               | The initial solution first created a maze and then DFS-ed through it. Current solution immediately calculates the distances, for 3x performance gain.

[Here](inputs/21-annotated.txt) is a part of it.
[Day 22: Chronal Conversion](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/22)          | [day22.nim](nim/day22.nim) |                             |                               | The first time in four years that I use [`A*` algorithm](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#astar) for some AoC task.
